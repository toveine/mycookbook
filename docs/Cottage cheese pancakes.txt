Cottage cheese pancakes (syrniki)

Ingredients:

- Cottage cheese: 180g
- Wheat flour: 1 heaping tablespoon
- Egg yolk: 1
- Sugar: 1 tablespoon (more or less, depends on your taste)
- Salt: a pinch

How to cook:

1. Put all ingredients into a bowl and mix it well.
2. Prepare a cutting board or any other comfortable area with some flour on it.
3. Take a tablespoon of cottage cheese weight and form a ball with your hands. A piece of advice: wet your hands before forming a ball.
4. Roll a ball in flour (not too much!) then press it a little to get a tall (about 1.5-2cm in height) pancake.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 while there is cottage cheese weight.
6. Grease your pan with butter or oil a little bit and warm it up.
7. Put syrniki onto the pan.
8. Cook it until you get brown crust then flip syrniki.
9. Cook another side then put it away on a plate.
  You can serve the pancakes with jam, honey, smetana or just sprinkle with powdered sugar.
