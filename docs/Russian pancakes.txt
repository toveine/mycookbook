Russian pancakes (bliny)

Ingredients:

- Milk: 500ml
- Wheat flour: 1.5 cup (cup is 200ml or 250ml)
- Eggs: 3
- Salt: 1/2 teaspoon
- Sugar: 1/2 tablespoon (you can add some more, if it will be sweet bliny with jam or honey as a dessert, for example)
- Vegetable oil: 2 tablespoons

How to cook:

1. Break eggs into a bowl and whisk it a little bit.
2. Add sugar, salt and half of milk into the bowl and mix it.
3. Gradually add sifted flour and mix it.
4. Gradually add another half of milk and mix it again (your dough must not contain lumps!).
5. Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and mix it, yes, again.
6. See if dough looks like a liquid smetana or a double cream. If your dough is liquid, you can add some flour.
7. Grease your pan with butter or oil a little bit and warm it up.
8. Pour some dough out onto the pan, while turning the pan in circular shape (Dough must cover the bottom of the pan thinly. Do it fast, because the pan is hot and dough will cling to the pan).
9. Cook it until you get brown crust then flip the blin.
10. Cook another side then put it away on a plate.
11. Repeat steps 8-10 while there is dough. :)
